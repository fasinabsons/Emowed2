**Target:** ₹85,000 per wedding × 10,000 weddings/year = ₹85 Crore annual revenue by Year 3

---

## 1. CORE REVENUE STREAMS (Existing in PRD)

### 1.1 Premium Subscriptions
```
Pricing Tiers:
├── Free: ₹0 (7-day storage, limited features)
├── Quarterly: ₹2,999 (₹1,000/month)
├── Annual: ₹9,999 (₹833/month, 17% discount) ⭐ MOST POPULAR
└── Lifetime: ₹24,999 (3-year payback)

Expected Split:
├── Free: 40% of users
├── Quarterly: 20% of users
├── Annual: 35% of users
└── Lifetime: 5% of users

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):
(0.4 × ₹0) + (0.2 × ₹12,000) + (0.35 × ₹9,999) + (0.05 × ₹24,999)
= ₹0 + ₹2,400 + ₹3,500 + ₹1,250
= ₹7,150/user/year

For 10,000 wedding couples:
₹7,150 × 20,000 users = ₹14.3 Crore/year
```

### 1.2 Vendor Commissions
```
Model:
├── Free tier vendors: 12% commission
├── Paid tier vendors: 3% commission
└── Incentivizes vendor subscriptions

Average Wedding Vendor Spend: ₹5,00,000

├── Decorator: ₹1,00,000

├── Weighted avg: (0.8 × 3%) + (0.2 × 12%) = 4.8%

Revenue: ₹5,00,000 × 4.8% = ₹24,000 per wedding
For 10,000 weddings: ₹24 Crore/year
```

### 1.3 Gift Marketplace Commission
```
Model:
├── Physical products: 5% commission
├── Gift cards: 3% commission

For 10,000 weddings: ₹5 Crore/year
```

**Core Revenue Total: ₹14.3 + ₹24 + ₹5 = ₹43.3 Crore/year**

---

## 2. INNOVATIVE REVENUE STREAMS (NEW IDEAS)

### 2.1 Wedding Insurance (Blue Ocean!)

**Problem:** Indian weddings have massive financial risk
- Vendor no-shows (photographer doesn't show up)
- Weather disasters (outdoor wedding rained out)
- Family emergencies (sudden cancellation)
- Vendor quality issues (food poisoning, bad photos)

**Solution:** Emowed Wedding Insurance
```
Coverage Tiers:
├── Basic (₹2,999):
│   ├── Vendor no-show: Up to ₹50,000 refund
│   ├── Weather cancellation: Rescheduling covered
│   └── Medical emergencies: Partial refund
│
├── Standard (₹4,999):
│   ├── All Basic +
│   ├── Vendor performance guarantee: Quality issues covered
│   ├── Guest travel insurance: Up to ₹25,000 per guest
│   └── Photography backup: Emergency photographer arranged
│
└── Premium (₹9,999):
    ├── All Standard +
    ├── Cancellation for any reason: 50% refund
    ├── Liability coverage: Up to ₹5,00,000
    └── International guest coverage

Partnership Model:
├── Partner with insurance companies (Bajaj Allianz, ICICI Lombard)
├── Emowed white-labels the insurance
├── Emowed gets 30% commission
└── Insurance company handles claims

Revenue Calculation:
├── 30% of couples buy insurance
├── Average premium: ₹5,000
├── Emowed commission: 30% = ₹1,500
├── For 10,000 weddings: 3,000 × ₹1,500 = ₹45 Lakh/year

Future Growth:
- As wedding insurance becomes norm, 80% adoption
- Revenue potential: ₹1.2 Crore/year at scale
```

**Why This Works:**
✅ India has NO wedding insurance market (first mover!)
✅ High-value weddings = willing to pay for protection
✅ Creates trust (vendor no-show covered)
✅ Upsell opportunity (show horror stories)

### 2.2 Dynamic Vendor Bidding System

**Concept:** Reverse auction where vendors compete for wedding contracts

**How It Works:**
```
Step 1: Couple creates wedding request
├── Date: Dec 15, 2025
├── Venue: Mumbai
├── Guest count: 200
├── Budget: ₹5,00,000
└── Requirements: Vegetarian catering, live music

Step 2: System notifies matching vendors
├── 15 caterers in Mumbai
├── All have Dec 15 available
└── All sent wedding request

Step 3: Vendors submit competitive bids
├── Vendor A: ₹4,80,000 (4% discount)
├── Vendor B: ₹4,50,000 (10% discount)
├── Vendor C: ₹5,20,000 (premium service)
└── Bids visible to couple only

Step 4: Family voting + Selection
├── Family ranks vendors (price + quality)
├── Couple makes final decision
└── Winner confirmed

Monetization:
├── Vendor pays ₹500 to submit bid (non-refundable)
├── Winner pays standard commission (3-12%)
├── Encourages quality bids, not spam
└── Additional ₹7,500 per wedding (15 vendors × ₹500)

Revenue:
For 10,000 weddings: ₹7,500 × 10,000 = ₹7.5 Crore/year
```

**Benefits:**
- Couples save money (competitive pricing)
- Vendors get quality leads (serious couples only)

## 5. PRICING PSYCHOLOGY OPTIMIZATION

### 5.1 Anchoring Strategy (Already in PRD)
```
Show most expensive first:
₹49,999 Enterprise → Makes ₹9,999 seem cheap
```

### 5.2 Charm Pricing
```
Instead of: ₹10,000
Use: ₹9,999

Psychology: Feels significantly cheaper (left-digit effect)
Result: 20% higher conversions
```

### 5.3 Decoy Pricing
```
Add middle option to make target more attractive:

FREE: ₹0 (limited)
──────────────────
BASIC: ₹5,999 ← Decoy (intentionally unattractive)
├── 30-day storage
├── 500 photos
└── Basic features

PREMIUM: ₹9,999 ← Target (best value!)
├── Forever storage
├── Unlimited photos
├── All features
└── "Most Popular" badge
```

Result: 80% choose Premium instead of Free

### 5.4 Loss Aversion Framing
```
❌ "Upgrade to GET forever storage"
✅ "Upgrade to AVOID losing your 245 wedding photos"

Result: 2x higher conversions
```

---

## 6. REVENUE DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS

### Why Multiple Revenue Streams Matter:

**1. Risk Mitigation**
```
If vendor commissions drop 50%:
├── Impact: -₹12 Crore
├── But 12 other streams still active
└── Total revenue only drops 21%

vs Single Revenue Model:
├── Impact: -₹12 Crore
└── Total revenue drops 50%!
```

**2. Higher Valuation**
```
Valuation Multipliers:
├── Pure subscription: 5-8x revenue
├── Marketplace: 10-15x revenue
├── B2B SaaS: 12-20x revenue
└── Diversified: 15-25x revenue

Emowed at ₹100 Crore revenue:
├── Diversified: ₹1,500-2,500 Crore valuation
└── Single stream: ₹500-800 Crore valuation
```

**3. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
```
Traditional Wedding App:
├── User signs up
├── Plans wedding
├── Wedding happens
├── User leaves
└── LTV: ₹10,000

Emowed:
├── User signs up (matchmaking: ₹9,999)
├── Gets engaged (continues using)
├── Plans wedding (vendor commissions: ₹24,000)
├── Wedding happens (gift commissions: ₹5,000)
├── Post-wedding (subscription box: ₹6,000/year)
├── Annual renewals (₹9,999/year)
└── LTV: ₹9,999 + ₹24,000 + ₹5,000 + ₹6,000/year × 5 years
    = ₹68,999 over 5 years!

7x higher LTV = 7x higher business value!
```

---
