## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### Manual Testing (MVP)
```
Critical User Flows:
1. Sign up → Verify email → Login
2. Invite partner → Partner accepts → Engaged
3. Create wedding → Add event → Success
4. Invite parent → Parent accepts → Invites uncle
5. Guest RSVPs → Headcount updates
6. Invite vendor → Vendor quotes → Book vendor
7. Upload photo → Gallery updates
8. Free user → 7 days pass → Upgrade prompt

Test each flow weekly.
```

### Automated Testing (Post-MVP)
```
1. Unit tests (Jest)
2. Integration tests (React Testing Library)
3. E2E tests (Playwright)
4. Performance tests (Lighthouse)
```

---

## 📊 ANALYTICS SETUP

### Mixpanel Setup
```
1. Create Mixpanel account (free)
2. Get project token
3. Install: npm install mixpanel-browser
4. Track key events:
   - User signed up
   - Partner invited
   - Wedding created
   - Guest invited
   - Vendor booked
   - Photo uploaded
   - Upgraded to premium
```

### Google Analytics 4
```
1. Create GA4 property
2. Get measurement ID
3. Install: npm install @next/third-parties
4. Add to _app.tsx
5. Track page views automatically
```

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
```
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com
3. Import GitHub repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy
6. Custom domain: emowed.com
7. Set up preview environments

Auto-deploys on every push to main.
```

### Supabase Deployment
```
Already cloud-hosted!
Just ensure:
- RLS policies enabled
- Backups configured
- Connection pooling set up
```

---

## 💡 DEVELOPMENT TIPS

### Use Lovable.dev Effectively
```
Prompt examples:
"Create a wedding creation form with 5 steps matching the specification in pages/05_wedding_creation.txt"

"Implement the partner invitation card from pages/03_dashboard_single.txt with code generation logic"

"Build the guest management table with hierarchical permissions from pages/08_guest_management.txt"
```

### Reuse Components
```
Don't rebuild:
- Buttons (defined in theme.txt)
- Cards (defined in theme.txt)
- Modals (defined in theme.txt)
- Forms (defined in theme.txt)

Build once, use everywhere!
```

### Performance Optimization
```
1. Code splitting: lazy load routes
2. Image optimization: use Next/Image
3. API caching: use React Query
4. Database indexes: already in architecture.txt
5. CDN: use Cloudinary transformations
```
