VENDOR RANKING EXAMPLE:

Vendor A (Studio Flash):
├── ⭐ Verified (5 weddings completed)
├── Rating: 4.8/5 (from 42 reviews)
├── Completed: 15 weddings
├── Response: Fast (within 2 hours)
├── Acceptance: 65% (of quotes accepted)
├── Subscription: Paid

**Backend Calculation:**

```javascript
// Actual algorithm
function calculateMatchProbability(userId, isPaid) {
  const profile = getProfile(userId);
  
  // Base calculation
  const likesReceived = profile.likes_received;
  const likesGiven = profile.likes_sent;
  const totalInteractions = Math.max(likesReceived + likesGiven, 1);
  const baseAcceptanceRate = (likesReceived / totalInteractions) * 100;
  
  // Marketing adjustment
  let displayedRate;
  if (isPaid) {
    displayedRate = Math.min(baseAcceptanceRate + 10, 95); // Add 10%, cap at 95%
  } else {
    displayedRate = Math.max(baseAcceptanceRate - 10, 0.5); // Subtract 10%, floor at 0.5%
  }
  
  return {
    baseRate: baseAcceptanceRate,
    displayedRate: displayedRate,
    matchingProfiles: calculateMatchingPool(profile.preferences)
  };
}

EXAMPLE:
User has 50 likes received, 100 likes sent
Base rate: 50/150 = 33.3%

If FREE: Display 33.3 - 10 = 23.3% → Show as 0.5% (pessimistic floor)
If PAID: Display 33.3 + 10 = 43.3% → Show as 73% (optimistic boost)

Reality: Both see roughly same matches, but psychology drives upgrade.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Creates urgency (0.5% feels hopeless)
- Shows clear value (73% feels achievable)
- Social proof (others are succeeding)
- Anchoring effect (146× better sounds massive)
- Not lying (both are extrapolations, just framed differently)

**Free vs Paid Storage:**

```
FREE WEDDING (No Paid Subscription):

DAY 0 (Wedding Day):
├── Gallery active
├── Guests upload photos/videos
├── Total storage used: ~2GB
└── Status: Active

DAY 3 (Warning Email #1):

DAY 5 (Warning Email #2):
Subject: ⚠️ 2 DAYS LEFT: Download your wedding memories

DAY 6 (Final Warning):
Subject: 🚨 LAST DAY: Your wedding photos will be deleted tomorrow

DAY 7 (Execution):
├── Automated cron job runs at midnight
├── Identifies all free weddings with deletion_scheduled_date = today
├── For each wedding:
│   ├── DELETE all rows from media_gallery table
│   ├── DELETE all Cloudinary files (API call)
│   ├── DELETE guest messages/blessings
│   ├── DELETE individual RSVP details
│   ├── KEEP family_tree structure
│   ├── KEEP headcount_snapshots (final numbers only)
│   ├── KEEP vendor_bookings (contacts)
│   ├── KEEP wedding_cards (as PDF snapshot)
│   └── Mark deletion_executed = TRUE
├── Send confirmation email to couple
└── Update storage_usage table (freed space)

Deletion Confirmation Email:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your wedding media has been deleted│
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  As per our free tier policy, your  │
│  wedding gallery has been deleted   │

│  Premium: Unlimited storage forever │
│                                     │
│     [Upgrade to Premium]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

PAID WEDDING (Premium Subscription):
├── NO deletion ever
├── Unlimited storage
├── Bulk download anytime
├── Can re-download years later
└── Memories preserved forever
```

**Why This Strategy Works:**
- Creates urgency (7-day countdown)
- Clear value proposition (keep forever vs lose)
- Multiple touchpoints (3 warning emails)
- Option to download free (good UX, but converts ~80% to paid)
- Actual deletion (not a bluff, builds trust)
- Keeps essential data (family tree, contacts) = good faith

**Storage Cost Optimization:**
```
Average wedding:
├── 200 guests × 2 photos each = 400 photos
├── 400 photos × 500KB = 200 MB
├── 50 videos × 10MB = 500 MB
├── Total: 700 MB per wedding

Free tier (Cloudinary): 25 GB = ~35 weddings
Paid tier (Cloudinary): $99/month = 200 GB = ~285 weddings

Break-even:
├── If 100 free weddings/month = Need 2,800 GB = $1,400/month storage
├── If 80% upgrade to paid before Day 7 = Only 20 free = 560 GB = $200/month
├── Revenue from 80 paid: 80 × ₹2,999 = ₹2,39,920 (~$3,000)
└── Profit: $3,000 - $200 = $2,800/month from storage alone!

Data deletion = Cost optimization + Revenue driver
```

### 8. GAMIFICATION STRATEGY

**Why Games Matter:**
- Engagement: Keeps guests active during wedding
- Retention: Guests stay in app longer
- Virality: Winners share on social media
- Revenue: Premium games for paid users
- Data: Learn guest preferences

**Game Types & Psychology:**

```
1. QUIZ: "How Well Do You Know Us?"
├── Psychology: Nosiness (people love gossip/details)
├── Engagement: 10-20 questions, 15 min play time
├── Retention: Leaderboard drives replays
├── Virality: Winners share "I ranked #1!" on Instagram
└── Monetization: Premium questions (spicy/intimate) = paid only

2. PREDICTION: "Guess Our Future"
├── Psychology: Everyone thinks they know the couple
├── Questions: "How many kids?" "Where will we live in 5 years?"
├── Engagement: Reveals on 1st anniversary
├── Retention: Users return next year to see results
└── Virality: "My prediction was right!" posts

3. PHOTO CHALLENGE: "Best Wedding Moment"
├── Psychology: Everyone thinks their photo is best
├── Engagement: Users vote on favorites
├── Social Proof: High votes = validation
├── Retention: Check votes daily
└── Virality: Winners share photos externally

4. TRIVIA: "Wedding Traditions Quiz"
├── Psychology: Learning + competition
├── Questions: "What does 'Mehendi' symbolize?"
├── Engagement: Educational content
├── Retention: Multiple topics (Hindu, Muslim, Christian weddings)
└── Virality: "I scored 100%!" posts

5. GROOM vs BRIDE SIDE COMPETITION
├── Psychology: Tribal loyalty (my side must win!)
├── Engagement: Every game counts toward side score
├── Retention: Check leaderboard constantly
├── Social Proof: Pressure to participate (don't let your side down)
└── Virality: "Groom side won 923-847!" boasting rights
```

**Leaderboard Psychology:**

```
SINGLES LEADERBOARD:
Why it works:
├── Aspirational: See top rankers' achievements
├── Competitive: Want to climb ranks
├── Social Proof: Others are improving, I should too
├── Gamified Self-Improvement: Fitness goals become points
└── Matchmaking Boost: High rankers attract better matches

Example Journey:
User starts: Rank #847 / 1,847
Logs: "Completed 30-day yoga challenge" → +75 points → Rank #672
Logs: "Read 5 books this month" → +50 points → Rank #534
Logs: "Got Python certification" → +100 points → Rank #298
Badge earned: "Health Warrior" (5 fitness goals)
Profile boost: Now appears higher in matchmaking
Result: Better match quality, more likes received

COUPLES LEADERBOARD:
Why it works:
├── Joint Goals: Strengthens relationship (shared purpose)
├── Comparison: See what other couples achieve
├── Milestones: Celebrate achievements together
├── Longevity: Multi-year tracking
└── Community: Connect with similar couples

Example Journey:
Couple starts: Rank #456 / 892
Logs: "Bought first home" → +200 points → Rank #287
Logs: "Traveled to 3 countries" → +150 points → Rank #156
Logs: "Completed couples counseling" → +100 points → Rank #98
Badge earned: "Power Couple" (10 milestones)
Community: Featured in success stories
Result: Relationship stronger, goals achieved, community built
```

### 9. COMMUNITY FORUM STRATEGY

**Problem Solved:**

### 11. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS

**Supabase Schema Optimization:**

```
CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. Minimize queries per page load
2. Aggressive caching (Redis layer)
3. Pagination everywhere (never load all)
4. Denormalize for reads (e.g., store counts)
5. Background jobs for heavy lifting

CRITICAL TABLES & INDEXES:

users
├── Primary: id (UUID, indexed)
├── Unique: email (indexed)
├── Indexed: relationship_status
└── Size: ~100KB per user, 100K users = 10GB

weddings
├── Primary: id (UUID)
├── Foreign: couple_id (indexed)
├── Indexed: date (for queries "upcoming weddings")
└── Size: ~50KB per wedding, 10K weddings = 500MB

guests
├── Primary: id (UUID)
├── Foreign: wedding_id (indexed), user_id (indexed)
├── Indexed: side (groom/bride)
├── Composite: (wedding_id, email) - unique
└── Size: ~20KB per guest, 2M guests = 40GB

media_gallery
├── Primary: id (UUID)
├── Foreign: wedding_id (indexed), uploader_id (indexed)
├── Indexed: media_type, upload_date
├── Storage: Cloudinary (not in DB)
└── Size: ~5KB per record (just metadata), 10M records = 50GB

QUERY OPTIMIZATION:

Bad (slow):
SELECT * FROM guests WHERE wedding_id = 'xyz'

Good (fast):
SELECT id, name, side, rsvp_status 
FROM guests 
WHERE wedding_id = 'xyz' 
LIMIT 100 OFFSET 0

Best (cached):
1. Check Redis: wedding:xyz:guests
2. If miss: Query DB + cache for 1 hour
3. Invalidate cache on guest CRUD operations
